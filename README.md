# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze retail sales data from a Coffee Shop to uncover actionable insights that can significantly enhance its performance. By examining sales trends across various dimensions—such as time of day, day of the week, product categories, and store locations—we aim to identify patterns that can inform strategic decisions to boost sales and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset Description
The analysis is based on sales data collected from multiple Coffee Shop locations. The dataset includes details such as the date and time of transactions, product categories, quantities sold, prices, and total sales revenue. This rich dataset enables a comprehensive examination of sales performance across different facets of the business.

### Key Questions
- How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
- Are there any peak times for sales activity?
- What is the total sales revenue for each month?
- How do sales vary across different store locations?
- What is the average price per order per person?
- Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?
- How do sales vary by product category and type?

## Recommended Analysis
To derive meaningful insights from the data, the following analyses are recommended:
- Time Series Analysis to understand sales trends over time.
- Comparative Analysis of sales performance across different store locations.
- Product Performance Analysis to identify top-selling and underperforming products.
- Customer Behavior Analysis to understand spending patterns and preferences.
